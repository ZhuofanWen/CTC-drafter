We can then use this information to determine how many miles she can travel by running and walking.\n\nFirst, let's determine how many miles Dana can run in six hours. Since she can run at a rate of speed four times faster than she can walk, we know that she can run at a rate of 4x the speed of her walking speed. If she can run at 4x her walking speed for six hours, she will have run 4x the distance she would have traveled if she had walked for six hours.\n\nNext, let's determine how many miles Dana can walk in six hours. Since she spends two-thirds of her time walking and one-third of her time running, we know that she spends twice as much time walking as she does running. This means that she can walk twice as far as she can run in the same amount of time.\n\nNow, let's put these two pieces of information together to determine how many miles Dana can travel in six hours by running and walking. Since she can run at a rate of 4x the speed of her walking speed, we know that she can run at a rate of 4x the distance she can walk in six hours. This means that she can run 4x the distance she can walk in six hours, which is equal to 4x the distance she can walk in three hours.\n\nFinally, we can use the fact that Dana can skip at a rate of speed that is half as fast as she can run to determine how many miles she can travel by skipping. Since she can skip at a rate of 3 miles per hour, we know that she can skip at a rate of 1.5x the speed of her walking speed. This means that she can skip 1.5x the distance she can walk in six hours, which is equal to 1.5x the distance she can walk in three hours.\n\nIn summary, Dana can travel 4x the distance she can walk in three hours by running, 4x the distance she can walk in three hours by walking, and 1.5x the distance she can walk in three hours by skipping. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\nDana can travel 4x(4x the distance she can walk in three hours) + 4x(the distance she can walk in three hours) + 1.5x(the distance she can walk in three hours) = 16x + 4 + 1.5 = 21.5 miles in six hours. ###"], "idxs": [163], "new_tokens": [576], "wall_time": [9.821045160293579]}], "tstamp": 1729604210.5564873}

So, the total time he spent watching the 30-minute show on Wednesday was a few episodes \\* 30 minutes/episode.\n\nWe also know that Frankie watched a 1-hour episode on Thursday.

Let's use \"x\" to represent the number of old records brought in by each person.\n\nThe total number of old records brought in by the 5 people is 5x.\nThe\n\ntotal number of new records received by the 5 people is 7.\n\nWe know that for every 2 old records, 1 new record can be received. So, we can set up the following equation:\n\n5x = 7 \\* 2\n\nTo solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:\n\n5x = 14\nx = 14/5\n\nThe answer is x = 14/5, which is approximately 2.8. However, the question asks for the total number of old records brought in, not the average number of of records brought in per person.\n\nTo find the total number of old records brought in, we need to multiply the number of old records brought in by each person by the number of people.\n\n5x = 5 \\* 2.8 = 14\n\nSo, the 5 people brought in 14 old records.\n\nThe final answer is 14 old records. ###"], "idxs": [86], "new_tokens": [284], "wall_time": [5.196728944778442]}], "tstamp": 1729605471.2720637}

To find the number find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to first find the total number of riders who can stay upright on the wave.\n\nWe know that 25% of the riders can stay upright on the wave, which means that 75% of the riders cannot stay upright on the wave. This means that the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave is 25% of 100, or 25.\n\nSince 60% of the riders who can stay upright on the wave are women, this means that 40% of the riders who can stay upright on the wave are men. To find the number of men who can stay upright on the wave, we need to divide the total number of riders who can stay upright on the wave by 40%.\n\nThe number of men who can stay upright on the wave is 25 / 0..4, which simplifies to 62.5.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 62.5 men can stay upright on the wave. ###"], "idxs": [105], "new_tokens": [394], "wall_time": [6.3748955726623535]}], "tstamp": 1729606801.5589743}

We can do this by multiplying the number of snowballs he can build in 1 hour by the number of hours it will take to build 60 snowballs:\n\n20 snowballs/hour \\* (1 hour + 15 minutes/hour) = 20 snowballs/hour \\* 1 hour 11.11111111111111 minutes/hour\n\nThis is equivalent to 20 snowballs/hour \\* 1 hour 11.11111111111111 minutes/hour = 22 snowballs/hour\n\nSo, in 1 hour and 15 minutes, Jay will be able to build 22 snowballs.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many snowballs Jay will be melt in this same amount of time.

We can start by using the fact that Aaron was able to run each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. This means that Vanessa's time for each mile is twice Aaron's time for each mile.\n\nWe also know that Vanessa was able to run twice as far as Aaron did. This means that Vanessa ran 4 miles, while Aaron ran 2 miles.\n\nWe can use this information to set up the following equation:\n\nVanessa's time for 4 miles = Aaron's time for 2 miles\n\nVanessa's time for 4 miles / Aaron's time for 2 miles = 2 / 1\n\nVanessa's time for 4 miles / Aaron's time for 2 miles = 2\n\nNow we need to solve for Vanessa's time for 4 miles. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by Aaron's time for 2 miles:\n\nVanessa's time for 4 miles \\* Aaron's time for 2 miles = 2 \\* Aaron's time for 2 miles\n\nVanessa's time for 4 miles = 2 \\* Aaron's time for 2 miles\n\nVanessa's time for 4 miles = 2 \\* (16 / 4)\n\nVanessa's time for 4 miles = 16 / 2\n\nVanessa's time for 4 miles = 8 minutes\n\nTherefore, Vanessa took 8 minutes to complete her part of the relay race. ###"], "idxs": [103], "new_tokens": [378], "wall_time": [6.256875514984131]}], "tstamp": 1729610052.808742}

This can be done by dividing the total number of feet of dock by 3, which gives us 206 / 3 = 68.67 feet of dock.\n\nSince it is not possible to have a fraction of a foot of dock, the caretaker needs to have 68 feet of dock in order to have 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. This means that he needs to buy 68 - 200 = -132 feet of dock, which is not possible.\n\nTherefore, the caretaker does not need to buy any additional line, as he already has 6 feet of new line and 200 feet of dock.
