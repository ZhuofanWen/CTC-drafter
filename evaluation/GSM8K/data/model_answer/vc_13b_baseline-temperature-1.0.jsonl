The given information is that 2/5 of the students are boys, and 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. This information alone does not provide enough information to determine how many girls are not in the girl scout.\n\nTo solve this problem, you will need to use additional information or make some assumptions. One possible approach is to assume that the number of boys is equal to 2/5 of the total number of students, and the number of girls is equal to 3/5 of the total number of students. Then, you can use this information to calculate the total number of students, and subtract the number of girls in the girl scout to find the number of girls who are not in the girl scout.\n\nFor example, if we assume that there are 200 students, then the number of boys would be 2/5 \\* 200 = 40, and the number of girls would be 3/5 \\* 200 = 60. If 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout, then the number of girls in the girl scout would be 2/3 \\* 60 = 40. Therefore, the number of girls who are not in the girl scout would be 60 - 40 = 20.\n\nIt is important to note that this solution is based on the assumption that the number of boys is equal to 2/5 of the total number of students, and the number of girls is equal to 3/5 of the total number of students.

We know that Ruby is 6 times older than Sam, so Ruby's age is 6x. We are also told that in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so in 9 years, Ruby's age will be 3(6x) = 18x.\n\nWe are asked to find the age of Sam now. In 9 years, Sam will be (x+9), but in 9 years, Ruby will be 18x, so the age difference between them will be 18x - (x+9) = 18x - (x + 9) = 18x - x - 9 = 18x - 9.\n\nWe can plug in the value we know for the age difference, namely 18x - 9, into the equation for the age of Sam in 9 years, (x+9), and solve for x:\n\n18x - 9 = x + 9\n\nSubtracting x from both sides:\n\n17x - 9 = 9\n\nAdding 9 to both sides:\n\n17x = 18\n\nDividing both sides by 17:\n\nx = 18 / 17\n\nx = 1.06\n\nSo Sam is currently 1.06 years old.

However, we need to convert the cooling in degrees Celsius to cooling in milliliters, as the problem asks for how much weaker the coffee becomes.\n\nTo convert degrees Celsius to milliliters, we can use the following formula:\n\nmilliliters = volume x change in temperature\n\nwhere volume is the volume of the coffee and change in temperature is the cooling in degrees Celsius. We know that the volume of the coffee is 12 milliliters per degree Celsius of cooling. So:\n\nmilliliters = 12 mL/\u00b0C x cooling in \u00b0C\n\nWe can now calculate the amount of cooling in milliliters by multiplying the number of ice cubes by the cooling per ice cube and then multiplying by the volume of the coffee per degree Celsius:\n\nmilliliters of cooling = (number of ice cubes x cooling per ice cube) x volume of coffee per \u00b0C\n\nmilliliters of cooling = (15 ice cubes x 13 degrees) x 12 mL/\u00b0C\n\nmilliliters of cooling = 210 mL\n\nNow, we need to account for the cream added to the coffee.

If she read for 15 minutes each night, and she read a total of 100 pages in two weeks, then she must have spent 2\\*(100/15) = 40 minutes reading in two weeks.\n\nSince Judy read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, she must have read 2/1.5 = 4/3 pages per minute. Therefore, she read a total of 40/3 = 13\\frac{4}{3}34\u200b minutes in two weeks.\n\nTo find out how many pages she read in two weeks, we can multiply the number of minutes she spent reading by the number of pages she read per minute.

We can use the formula: distance = speed x time.\n\nFirst, we need to find the total distance traveled by both cars. We know that the first car is initially traveling at an average speed of 60 miles per hour. If the second car passes it at an average speed of 70 miles per hour, then they will catch up to the first car in 1 hour. In that hour, the first car travels 60 miles and the second car travels 70 miles, so they cover a total distance of 60 + 70 = 130 miles.\n\nSince they both maintain the same speed, after 2 hours, they will have traveled a total of 2 x 130 = 260 miles.\n\nNext, we need to find the relative speed between the two cars. We know that the second car is initially traveling at an average speed of 70 miles per hour when it passes the first car, so it will maintain that speed relative to the first car. Therefore, the first car will be traveling at an average speed of 70 - 60 = 10 miles per hour slower than the second car.\n\nIn 2 hours, the first car will travel 2 x 10 = 20 miles slower than the second car. So, the second car will travel a total of 260 - 20 = 240 miles in 2 hours.\n\nNow, we can find the distance between the two cars after 2 hours. The second car will have traveled 240 miles to the north, while the first car will have traveled 260 miles to the north minus 20 miles to the west. Therefore, the distance between the two cars after 2 hours is:\n\n260 miles - 20 miles = 240 miles\n\nSo, after 2 hours, the two cars will be 240 miles apart from each other. ###"], "idxs": [454], "new_tokens": [455], "wall_time": [20.970274448394775]}], "tstamp": 1729612579.3450494}

Therefore, the total number of slices that the watermelon can be divided into is twice the number of slices that the kids can be divided into.\n\nLet x be the number of slices that the watermelon can be divided into, and y be the number of slices that the kids can be divided into.

Jim had a $25,000 a year job before college, but he went to college for 4 years and did not work during that time. Therefore, he lost $25,000 x 4 = $100,000 in income.\n\nNow, we need to determine how much money Jim needs to earn to equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school. We can do this by adding the total amount of money Jim owes in loans to the total amount of money he lost in income: $200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000.\n\nTherefore, Jim needs to earn $300,000 to equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.\n\nThe final answer is $300,000. ###"], "idxs": [330], "new_tokens": [331], "wall_time": [15.305782794952393]}], "tstamp": 1729615064.6612465}

On the sidewalk, Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach.\n\nLet's first determine the total distance Grandma walks on the beach and the sidewalk.
