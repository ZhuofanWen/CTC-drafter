We know that Felix made $105 during the week.\n\nLet n represent the number of branches Felix climbed per day. Then, the total number of branches he climbed in a week would be 7n (since there are 7 days in a week).\n\nWe can now set up the following equation:\n\n7n \\* $.25 = 105\n\nWe need to solve for n. First, we will multiply both sides of the equation by 4 (to convert the 7n to 28n, which will make it easier to work with):\n\n28n \\* $.25 = 105 \\* $.25\n\nNow, we'll simplify the equation:\n\n28n = 26.25\n\nFinally, we'll solve for n:\n\nn = 26.25 / 28\nn = 0.9364\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a branch, we can round n to the nearest whole number. In this case, it would be 0.9364, which is closest to 0 (since 0.9364 is less than 1). So, Felix climbed an average of 0 branches per day.\n\nHowever, this answer doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, so it seems there might be a mistake in the question. If the question intends to ask about the average number of branches per day Felix climbed during the week, then we would need to know the total number of branches he climbed during the week to calculate the average. We would need more information to give an accurate answer.\n\nPlease check the question and provide further information if necessary.\n\n###"], "idxs": [403], "new_tokens": [404], "wall_time": [36.796847105026245]}], "tstamp": 1730194145.3543591}

To do this, we can divide the total number of slices (24) by the number of slices consumed per day (6):\n\n24 slices / 6 slices/day = 4 days\n\nSo, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days if both Abby and Josh eat at the same time.\n\nFinal answer: 4 days ###"], "idxs": [259], "new_tokens": [260], "wall_time": [23.6118483543396]}], "tstamp": 1730197019.5616632}

Calculate the total number of children in the drill.\n\nLet's break down the problem further:\n\n1. One row has 8 children standing in a row. So, if there are 7 rows (each for one school), then in each row, there will be a total of 8 children \\* 7 rows = 56 children.\n2. Five schools are taking part in the celebration. So, we need to multiply the number of children in one row (56) by the number of schools (5): 56 children \\* 5 schools = 280 children.\n3. Multiply the result from step 2 by the number of schools: 280 children \\* 5 schools = 1400 children.\n\nTherefore, there can be a total of 1400 children in the drill.\n\nFinal answer: 1400 children"], "idxs": [276], "new_tokens": [277], "wall_time": [25.166465997695923]}], "tstamp": 1730197528.7560356}

According to the problem, B2 is twice as old as B1, and B1 is 12 years old.\n\nWe can establish these relationships with equations:\n\nB2 = 2 \\* B1\nB1 = 12\n\nNow we need to find B2. To do this, we will use the information given about the sisters' ages. The sum of the ages of all siblings is equal to 2 \\* B2 + (3 \\* 16), since there are 2 brothers and 3 sisters.\n\n2 \\* B2 + (3 \\* 16) = 2 \\* B2 + 48\n\nWe know that 12 + 48 = 60, which is equal to 3 \\* 16 when the ages of the sisters are added. Therefore:\n\n2 \\* B2 = 3 \\* 16 - 12\n2 \\* B2 = 3 \\* 16 - 12\n2 \\* B2 = 48 - 12\n2 \\* B2 = 36\n\nNow, since B2 = 2 \\* B1, we can substitute B1's value into the equation:\n\n2 \\* (2 \\* B1) = 36\n4 \\* B1 = 36\n\nNow we need to find B1's value in terms of years:\n\n4 \\* B1 = 36\nB1 = 36 / 4\nB1 = 9\n\nNow we can find B2's value:\n\nB2 = 2 \\* B1\nB2 = 2 \\* 9\nB2 = 18\n\nSo the ages of the brothers are 9 and 18 years old, respectively.\n\nThe total age of all siblings is:\n\n2 \\* B1 + (3 \\* 16) + B2\n2 \\* 9 + (3 \\* 16) + 18\n2 \\* 9 + 48 + 18\n\nThe sum of the ages is:\n\n2 \\* 9 + 48 +"], "idxs": [511], "new_tokens": [512], "wall_time": [46.53181743621826]}], "tstamp": 1730206841.1962533}
