Since Mitchel went down the slide 30 times, we can find the total number of times Anne could have gone down the slide if she didn't go 30% less than Mitchelel. To do this, we multiply Mitchel's number of times by 130% (since 130% of 30 is the same as 30 + 30% of 30, which is 30 + 0.3 \\* 30, which is 39). So, Anne could have gone down the slide 39 times.\n\nNow, since Anne actually went down the slide 30% less than this, we subtract 30% of 39 from 39, which is 39 - (0.3 \\* 39), which is 39 - 11.7, which is approximately 27.3. So, Anne actually went down the slide about 27 times.\n\nNow we know that A = A, and we can substitute this into the equation for the total number of times the kids went down the slide: 30 + A + 4 \\* A = 30 + A + 4 \\* 27.\n\nWe can simplify this equation by adding A to both sides: A + 4 \\* 27 = 30 + A + 4 \\* 27 - A.\n\nNow we can solve for A: A = (30 + 4 \\* 27) - (4 \\* 27), which is 30 + 112 - 112, which is 30.\n\nSo, Anne actually went down the slide 30 times.\n\nNow we know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne, so we can substitute this into the equation for the total number of times the kids went down the slide: 30 + A + 4 \\* A = 30 + A + 4 \\* 30.\n\nWe can simplify this equation by adding A to both sides: 4 \\* 30 = 30 + A + 4 \\* 30 - A.\n\nNow we can solve for A: A = (30 + 4 \\* 30) - (4 \\* 30), which is 30 + 120 - 122, which is -2.\n\nThis doesn't make sense, since Anne couldn't have gone down the slide negative times.

We assumed that Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, but it's possible that she went down the slide 30% more than Mitchel. In this case, we would have to subtract 30% of 30 from 30, which is 30 - (0.3 \\* 30), which is 30 - 9, which is 21. So, Anne actually went down the slide about 21 times.\n2. We assumed that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne much, but it's possible that he went down the slide 4 times less than Anne. In this case, we would have to multiply Anne's number of times by 4 and subtract it from the total number of times the kids went down the slide.\n\nSo, after reviewing our work, we can conclude that Anne went down the water slide 21 times, and Robert went down the water slide 4 times less than Anne, which is 4 \\* 21 - 4, which is 84 - 4, which is 78 times."], "idxs": [279], "new_tokens": [961], "wall_time": [40.155216217041016]}], "tstamp": 1730193894.5313382}

Elise has been selling her Dad's collection of 250 books for three years.\n2. Each book sells at 20$.\n3. She sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year.\n4. There are currently 50 unsold books.\n5. Her sales number this year is 45.\n\nWe can use this information to set up an equation to find the total amount of money she earned in the second year.\n\nLet X represent the number of books sold in the second year. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as in the current year, we can set up an equation as follows:\n\nX = (Number of books sold in the first year) / 2\n\nWe know that the total number of books sold in the first and second years is 250 (since she has been selling for three years). So, we can set up another equation:\n\nX + (Number of books sold in the first year) / 2 = 250\n\nWe also know that there are currently 50 unsold books. Since she has sold 45 books this year, the number of books left to sell this year is:\n\n50 - 45 = 5\n\nNow, let's find the number of books sold in the first year. We know that X = (Number of books sold in the first year) / 2. If we multiply both sides by 2, we get:\n\n2X = (Number of books sold in the first year)\n\nSince the total number of books sold in the first and second years is 250, we can substitute 250 for (Number of books sold in the first year) in the equation:\n\n2X = 250\n\nNow we have:\n\nX = 125\n\nSo, she sold 125 books in the first year. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as in the current year, she sold 250 books in the first year (125 \\* 2 = 250).\n\nNow we can substitute X and the number of books sold in the first year back into the equation X + (Number of books sold in the first year) / 2 = 250:\n\n125 + (250) / 2 = 250\n\nSolving for the total amount of money she earned in the second year, we get:\n\n12 = 250 - 125\n12 =  125\n\nThe total amount of money she earned in the second year is 125 \\* 20 = 2500 dollars.\n\nFinal answer: Elise earned 2500 dollars in the second year."], "idxs": [182], "new_tokens": [639], "wall_time": [26.016988277435303]}], "tstamp": 1730194466.7983482}

First, Billy spends his $10 on candy. We'll call the number of pounds of candy \"x\".\n2. Each pound of candy costs $1.50, so the total cost of the candy is 1.5x.\n3. After buying the candy, Billy has some change left. We'll call this amount \"c\".\n4. Billy takes half of his change (c) and spends it on gumballs. We'll call the number of gumballs he buys \"y\".\n5. Each gumball costs $.05, so the total cost of the gumballs is 0.05y.\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\n1. 1.5x = 10 (The cost of the candy is equal to the amount of money Billy started with)\n2. 0.05y = c/2 (The cost of the gumballs is equal to half of the change Billy had left)\n\nWe need to find out the value of \"x\" (the number of pounds of candy Billy bought). We can substitute the expression for \"y\" from equation 2 into equation 1:\n\n1.5x = 10 - (c/2)\n\nNow we need to find \"c\". We can do this by using the first equation and substituting \"x\" with the expression from equation 2:\n\nc = 10 - 1.5x + (0.05y/2)\n\nSince Billy bought 40 gumballs, we can substitute \"y\" with 40:\n\nc = 10 - 1.5x + (0.05 \\* 40/2)\nc = 10 - 1.5x + 10/2\nc = 10 - 1.5x + 5\n\nNow we have an equation with \"x\" and \"c\":\n\n1.5x = 10 - 5 - (c/2)\n\nWe can solve for \"x\" by multiplying both sides by 2 and then subtracting 5 and 10/2 from both sides:\n\n3x = 20 - c\n\nNow we need to find the value of \"c\". We can do this by substituting the expression for \"c\" we found earlier:\n\n3x = 20 - (10 - 1.5x + 10/2)\n3x = 1.5x + 5\n\nNow we have an equation with \"x\" and \"c\":\n\n1.5x + 5 = 3x\n\nWe can solve for \"x\" by subtracting  multiplying both sides by 2 and then subtracting 5 from both sides:\n\nx = 5/3\n\nNow we have the value of \"x\".

The probability of a candle both exploding and smelling like wet dog is (0.01 \\* 0.05) = 0.005.\n4. Finally, we need to find the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode. We will multiply the total number of candles (50000) by the probability from step 3. The number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 50000 \\* 0.005 = 250.00 candles.\n\nSo, the final answer is that Marcy can expect approximately 250 candles to both smell like wet dog and explode. ###"], "idxs": [97], "new_tokens": [323], "wall_time": [13.837416648864746]}], "tstamp": 1730195799.4432096}

We can do this by first isolating the term with the unknown age:\n\n3(nephew's age in 7 years) = 44 - 7\n3(nephew's age in 7 years) = 37\n\nNow, we can solve for the nephew's age in 7 years by dividing both sides by 3:\n\nnephew's age in 7 years = 37 / 3\nnephew's age in 7 years = 12.5\n\nSince we the nephew's age in 7 years, we can find the nephewhew's age today by subtracting 7 years from it:\n\nnephew's age today = 12.5 - 7\nnephew's age today = 5\n\nSo, the nephew is 5 years old today.\n\nFinal answer: The nephew is 5 years old today."], "idxs": [136], "new_tokens": [479], "wall_time": [19.176270961761475]}], "tstamp": 1730197601.9575806}

So, the ratio of sales total in the second month to the first month is 3:4.\n\nNow, let's use the given information to set up an equation. In the first month, the total amount she made was:\n\nTotal amount in the first month = R + G\nTotal amount in the first month = 0.5 \\* G + G = 1.5 \\* G\n\nIn the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, the total amount she made in the second month was:\n\nTotal amount in the second month = (3/4) \\* (1.5 \\* G)\nTotal amount in the second month = 1.5 \\* G / 4\n\nWe know that the total amount she made from selling green hats in two months is the same as the total amount she made from selling red hats in two months. So, we can set up an equation for the total amount made from red hats in two months:\n\nTotal amount from red hats in two months = 2 \\* R + 2 \\* (1.5 \\* G / 4)\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for R from the first equation:\n\nTotal amount from red hats in two months = 2 \\* (0.5 \\* G) + 2 \\* (1.5 \\* G / 4)\nTotal amount from red hats in two months = G + (3/4) \\* G\nTotal amount from red hats in two months = (5/4) \\* G\n\nSince the total amount made from red hats in two months is the same as the total amount made from green hats in two months, we can set up an equation for the total amount made from green hats in two months:\n\nTotal amount from green hats in two months = (5/4) \\* G\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for the total amount made from green hats in one month from the first equation:\n\nTotal amount in the first month = 1.5 \\* G\n\nSo, the total amount made from green hats in two months is:\n\n(5/4) \\* G = 1.5 \\* G\n\nNow, we can solve for G:\n\n(5/4) \\* G = 1.5 \\* G\n(1/4) \\* G = 0.5 \\* G\nGG = 0.5 \\* G\n\nSince G cannot be zero, we can divide both sides by 0.5:\n\nG = 1\n\nNow, we can find the total amount made from red hats in two months:\n\nTotal amount from red hats in two months = (5/4) \\* G = (5/4) \\* 1 = 5/4\n\nFinally, we can find the total amount Ariadne made in two months:\n\nTotal amount in two months = Total amount from red hats in two months + Total amount from green hats in two months\nTotal amount in two months = (5/4) + 1 = 1 + 5/4\n\nSince we cannot represent 5/4 as a whole number, we can round it to the nearest cent. 5/4 is equal to 1.25.

We can start by simplifying the equation:\n\nTotal bill \\* 0.6 = $125 - $40 - Total bill\n0.6 \\* Total bill = $85 - Total bill\n\nNow, we can solve for Total bill:\n\nTotal bill = $85 / (1 - 0.6)\nTotal bill = $85 / 0.4\nTotal bill = $212.50\n\nNow, we can find the cost of the heartworm check:\n\nCost of heartworm check = (Total bill \\* 0.6) = ($212.50 \\* 0.6) = $127.50\n\nNow, we can find the final cost:\n\nTotal cost = $40 + $127.50 = $167.50\n\nFinally, we can find out how much John leaves with:\n\nAmount left = $125 - $167.50 = -$42.50\n\nHowever, this result doesn't make sense since John can't have a negative amount left.

So, we can calculate the amount of gas used by dividing the total distance by the fuel efficiency:\n\nGas used = Total distance / Fuel efficiency\nGas used = 10 miles / 10 MPG\nGas used = 1 gallon\n\nSince Andy drives to work and back home five days a week, we need to multiply the gas used by 5 to find out how much gas he uses in a week:\n\nGas used per week = Gas used per day \\* Number of days\nGas used per week = 1 gallon \\* 5\nGas used per week = 5 gallons\n\nFinally, we need to find out how much money Andy spends on gas per week. We know that the current price for regular gas is $3/gallon. So, we can calculate the cost of gas by multiplying the number of gallons used by the price per gallon:\n\nCost of gas per week = Gas used per week \\* Price per gallon\nCost of gas per week = 5 gallons \\* $3/gallon\nCost of gas per week = $15\n\nSo, Andy's car consumes $15 worth of gas per week for his daily commute to work from Monday to Friday.\n\n###"], "idxs": [135], "new_tokens": [440], "wall_time": [19.162893056869507]}], "tstamp": 1730200367.7493033}

We can solve the equation:\n\n1.75G + F + 1.75G + 44 = 88\n\nNow we need to find the number of flights to France. We can use the information that the remaining flights are split equally between France and Germany:\n\nF = (Total Flights - 1.75G - 1.75G - 44) / 2\nF = (88 - 3.5G - 3.5G - 44) / 2\nF = (70.5 - 3.5G) / 2\n\nNow we need to find G, which is the number of flights to Greece. We can use the information that the first plane makes three-quarters of its flights to Greece:\n\nG = (Total Flights - F - F - P) / 4\nG = = (88 - F - F - 44) / 4\nG = (44 - F) / 4\n\nNow we have two equations:\n\nF = (70.5 - 3.5G) / 2\nG = (44 - F) / 4\n\nWe can substitute the equation for G into the equation for F:\n\nF = (70.5 - (44 - F) / 4) / 2\n\nNow we need to find F and G. We can solve the equation:\n\nF = (70.5 - (44 - F) / 4) / 2\nF = (70.5 - (44 - F) / 4) / 2\n\nF = (70.5 - (44 - F) / 4) / 2\nF = (70.5 - (44 - F) / 4) / 2\n\nF = (70.5 - (44 - F) / 4) / 2\nF = = (70.5 - (44 - F) / 4) / 2\nF = = (70.5 - (44 - F) / 4) / 2\nF = = (70.5 - (44 - F) / 4) / 2\nF\n\nF = 16\n\nNow we can find G:\n\nG = (44 - F) / 4\nG = (44 - 16) / 4\nG = 28 / 4\nGG = 7\n\nSo, the first plane takes 16 flights to France in one day, and it takes 7 flights to Greece."], "idxs": [252], "new_tokens": [865], "wall_time": [36.248820066452026]}], "tstamp": 1730203176.499878}

She makes $10 an hour from wages and another $15 an hour from tips. Since she works 40 hours a week, we can calculate her weekly wages and tips as follows:\n\nWeekly wages = $10/hour \\* 40 hours = $400\nWeekly tips = $15/hour \\* 40 hours = $600\n\nWeekly total income = Weekly wages + Weekly tips = $400 + $600 = $1,000\n\nNow, let's determine how much money she needs to save per week to reach the $2,000 goal.

We can solve the system of equations to find the values of x and y.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate x from equation (1) by multiplying both sides by 20%:\n\n(1) (20% of x) \\* 20% = 20 years \\* (100% of $100,000)\n\n(3) 4% of x = 20 years \\* (100% of $100,000)\n\nNow we can substitute equation (3) into equation (2):\n\n(2) x \\* 20% + y \\* 40% = 20 years \\* (100% of $100,000)\n\n(4) x \\* 20% + y \\* 40% = 4% of x + 20 years \\* (100% of $100,000)\n\nNow we can solve for y:\n\n(5) y = (4% of x + 20 years \\* (100% of $100,000)) - x \\* 20%\n\nTo find the final answer, we need to substitute the value of x from equation (1) into equation (5):\n\n(6) y = (4% of (20 years \\* (100% of $100,000) / 20%)) - (20 years \\* (100% of $100,000) / 20%)\n\ny = (4% of (10 years \\* $100,000)) - (10 years \\* $100,000)\n\ny = (4% of $1,000,000) - $1,000,000\n\ny = $40,000 - $1,000,000\n\ny = -$960,000\n\nThis result is incorrect, and there might be an error in the calculations. Let's try solving the problem again, more carefully:\n\nWe have the following equations:\n\n(1) 20% of x + 40% of x = 20 years \\* (100% of $100,000)\n(2) x \\* 20% + y \\* 40% = 20 years \\* (100% of $100,000)\n\nWe can solve equation (1) for x:\n\n(3) x = (20 years \\* (100% of $100,000)) / (20% + 40%)\n\nNow we can substitute x from equation (3) into equation (2):\n\n(4) y \\* 40% = (20 years \\* (100% of $100,000)) / (20% + 40%) - x \\* 20%\n\n(5) y = ((20 years \\* (100% of $"], "idxs": [290], "new_tokens": [1028], "wall_time": [41.95086598396301]}], "tstamp": 1730204562.5237548}

To find the final amount of the second medicine needed for 8 doses, we can substitute the expression for the total dosage from step 1 into the equation from step 2:\n\n8 \\* (14 mL + 3 \\* (second medicine)) = 8 \\* (14 mL + 3 \\* (second medicine))\n\nSince the expression for the total dosage is the same as the one for the second medicine, we can simplify the equation:\n\n8 \\* (14 mL + 3 \\* (second medicine)) = 8 \\* 14 mL + 8 \\* 3 \\* (second medicine)\n\n8 \\* 14 mL + 8 \\* 3 \\* (second medicine) = 112 mL + 8 \\* 3 \\* (second medicine)\n\nNow, we can solve for the second medicine:\n\n8 \\* 3 \\* (second medicine) = 112 mL - 112 mL\n8 \\* 3 \\* (second medicine) = 0 mL\n\nSince we can't mix 0 mL of the second medicine, we need to reconsider the problem. It's possible that there was a mistake in the problem statement, and Saanvi actually needs to mix 14 mL of the first medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine for one dosage. In that case, we would have:\n\n14 mL (first medicine) + 3 \\* 14 mL (second medicine) = total dosage\n\nFor 8 doses, we would have:\n\n8 \\* (14 mL + 3 \\* 14 mL) = 8 \\* 48 mL = 384 mL\n\nSo, for 8 doses, Saanvi would need to mix 384 mL of the first medicine with 384 mL of the second medicine.\n\nHowever, if the problem statement is correct as it is, and Saanvi needs to mix 14 mL of the first medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine for one dosage, then the final answer is0 mL of the second medicine, which is not possible.

Since he needs to cover a total distance of 200 yards to return home, we can express this as:\n\nx + y = 200\n\nAlso, we know that Phineas takes 1 minute to hop 20 yards on land and 1 minute to swim 10 yards in water. To find out how long it takes him to return home, we need to find the time it takes him to cover both the land and water distances.\n\nLet's first find out how long it takes him to cover the land distance. Since he hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute, it would take him:\n\nx / 20 = x/20\n\nto cover the distance on land.\n\nNow, let's find out how long it takes him to cover the water distance. Since he swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute, it would take him:\n\ny / 10 = y/10\n\nto cover the distance in water.\n\nSince half of the distance is on land and the other half is in water, we can express the total time it takes Phineas to return home as:\n\n(x/20) + (y/10)\n\nNow, we need to find the values of x and y. We have the equation: \n\nx + y = 200\n\nWe can use this equation to find the value of x in terms of y:\n\nx = 200 - y\n\nNow, we can substitute this expression for x in the equation for the total time it takes Phineas to return home:\n\n(200 -0y)/20 + y/10\n\nTo find the total time, we need to simplify this expression:\n\n(200 - y)/20 + y/10 = (200 - y)/20 + (y*2)/20 = (200 - y + y*2)/20 = (200 + y)/20\n\nNow, we need to find the value of y that makes the expression equal to 1, as Phineas needs 1 minute to return home.
