Since the serum makes a person grow an extra arm every three days and an extra leg every five days, we can use the following formulas:\n\nExtra arms in 15 days = (15 days - 3 days) / 3 days = 12 / 3 = 4\nExtra legs in 15 days = (15 days - 5 days) / 5 days = 10 / 5 = 2\n\nTherefore, a person will have 4 extra arms and 2 extra legs after 15 days.\n\nNow, we need to determine how many new limbs the serum will cause a person to grow in total. We can add the number of extra arms and extra legs to the original number of limbs a person has:\n\nTotal new limbs = original limbs + extra arms + extra legs\nTotal new limbs = 2 arms + 4 arms + 2 legs + 2 legs = 8 limbs\n\nTherefore, Helena's serum will cause a person to grow a total of 8 limbs if they drink it for 15 days.\n\nThe final answer is 8 limbs."], "idxs": [96], "new_tokens": [318], "wall_time": [3.9503917694091797]}], "tstamp": 1729588770.8390412}

Let's represent the number of lollipops Oscar has at each stage using variables:\n\n1. Before he eats any on the way to school: x\n2. After he eats 2 on the way to school: x - 2\n3. After he passes out 14 to his friends: y\n4. After he buys more on the way home: z\n5. After he eats 3 more that night: w\n6. After he eats 2 more in the morning: v\n\nWe can set up a system of equations to represent these stages:\n\nx + y = 24 (Equation 1)\nx - 2 + z = 24 (Equation 2)\nz + w = 24 (Equation 3)\nx + w = 24 (Equation 4)\nx + v = 24 (Equation 5)\n\nNow, we can solve this system of equations.\n\nFirst, let's solve for y and z:\n\ny = 24 - x\nz = 24 - x\n\nNow, let's substitute these expressions for y and z into Equation 3:\n\nx - 2 + (24 - x) = 24\n\nSimplify:\n\nx - 2 + 24 - x = 24\n\n2x - 4 = 24\n\n2x = 28\n\nx = 14\n\nNow, let's substitute x = 14 into Equations 1, 2, and 4:\n\n14 + y = 24\ny = 10\n\n14 - 2 + z = 24\nz = 12\n\n14 + w = 24\nw = 10\n\n14 + v = 24\nv = 10\n\nNow, we have the values of y, z, w, and v. We can use these values to find the final number of lollipops Oscar has:\n\nx = 14 (from Equation 1)\ny = 10 (from solving for y)\nz = 12 (from solving for z)\nw = 10 (from solving for w)\nv = 10 (from solving for v)\n\nx + y + z + w + v = 24 + 10 + 10 + 10 = 44\n\nSo, Oscar has 44 lollipops.

Since there are 12 boys and 6 girls, we can say that there are 12 / 6 = <<12/6=2>>2 girls>>2 girls in the park.\n\nFinally, we can add the number of boys and girls to find the total number of kids in the park. There are 2 + 12 = <<2+12=14>>14 kids in the park.\n\nSo, the final answer is 14."], "idxs": [57], "new_tokens": [209], "wall_time": [2.3684298992156982]}], "tstamp": 1729588971.8473105}

The question states that 3 customers were kicked out for this reason, so we can set up an equation as follows:\n\n3x = number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks\n\nNext, we need to find the number of customers kicked out for shoplifting. The question states that a number equals to four times that many minus 5 were kicked out for this reason, so we can set up an equation as follows:\n\n4x - 5 = number of customers kicked out for shoplifting\n\nFinally, we need to find the number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. The question states that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for this reason, so we can set up an equation as follows:\n\n3x = number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale\n\nNow we have three equations and three unknowns. We can solve this system of equations using the substitution method.\n\nFirst, let's solve the equation 3x = number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. We can multiply both sides by 3 to get:\n\n3x = 3 \\* number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx = number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale\n\nNext, let's solve the equation 4x - 5 = number of customers kicked out for shoplifting. We can subtract 5 from both sides to get:\n\n4x = number of customers kicked out for shoplifting + 5\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n4x = 4 \\* number of customers kicked out for shoplifting\n\nFinally, let's solve the equation 3x = number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks. We can multiply both sides by 3 to get:\n\n3x = 3 \\* number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx = number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks\n\nNow that we have solved all three equations, we can substitute the values we found for x into each equation to solve for the unknowns.\n\nFor example, to solve for the number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks, we can substitute x = 3 into the first equation:\n\n3x = 3 \\* number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks\n3x = 9\nx = 3\n\nSo, 3 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for refusing to wear masks.\n\nTo solve for the number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale, we can substitute x = 3 into the second equation:\n\n4x - 5 = number of customers kicked out for shoplifting\n4 \\* 3 - 5 = number of customers kicked out for shoplifting + 5\n12 - 5 = number of customers kicked out for shoplifting + 5\n7 = number of customers kicked out for shoplifting + 5\n\nSo, 7 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for shoplifting.\n\nFinally, to solve for the number of customers kicked out for other reasons, we can substitute x = 3 into the third equation:\n\n3x = number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale\n3 \\* 3 = number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale\n3 = number of customers kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale\n\nSo, 3 customers were kicked out of the Walmart for physical violence over goods on sale.\n\nPutting it all together, we can see that a total of 50 people were kicked out of the Walmart. 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks, 7 customers were kicked out for shoplifting, and 3 customers were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale. Therefore, 50 - 3 - 7 - 3 = 17 people were kicked out of the Walmart for other reasons.\n\nThe final answer is 17."], "idxs": [262], "new_tokens": [972], "wall_time": [10.697471618652344]}], "tstamp": 1729588983.410546}

If Haley is 26 years old, how old is Geb?\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find the age of Geb in terms of Haley's age. We can use the information given in the problem to set up an equation.\n\nLet x be the age of Haley. Then, we know that Geb is 10 less than half of x.\n\nGeb = 10 - (1/2)x\n\nWe also know that Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley, so we can write:\n\nGeb = 10 - (1/2)x = 10 - 5x\n\nNow, we can substitute the expression for Geb into the equation we derived earlier:\n\n10 - 5x = 1/2x\n\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\n9x = 10\n\nx = 1.11\n\nSo, Haley is 26 + 1.11 =1 1.11 years old.\n\nNow, we can find Geb's age by plugging Haley's age into the equation we derived earlier:\n\nGeb = 10 - (1/2)x\n\nGeb = 10 - (1/2)(1.11)\n\nGeb = 10 - 0.555\n\nGeb = 9.445\n\nTherefore, Geb is 9.445 years old.\n\nThe final answer is: Geb is 9.445 years old."], "idxs": [103], "new_tokens": [374], "wall_time": [4.2384655475616455]}], "tstamp": 1729591619.800041}

So, he made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day and put them in the refrigerator cooler.  But later that evening, his children discovered the delicious nectar and robbed the cooler, drinking 4 of those gallons of root beer.  On the second day, his wife Barbie also discovered the root beer and accidentally spilled 7 gallons. On the third day, Fred's friend Ronnie visited Fred's house and helped himself to the root beer, further reducing the amount remaining by 5 gallons.  On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party.  If Fred and the others shared the remaining root beer equally, how much was available for each to drink during the party?\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to find out how much root beer was left after the children, Barbie, and Ronnie drank and spilled some.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how much root beer was left after the children drank 4 gallons:\n24 gallons - 4 gallons = <<24-4=20>>20 gallons\n\nNext, we need to find out how much root beer was left after Barbie spilled 7 gallons:\n20 gallons - 7 gallons = <<20-7=13>>13 gallons\n\nFinally, we need to find out how much root beer was left after Ronnie drank 5 gallons:\n13 gallons - 5 gallons = <<13-5=8>>8 gallons\n\nTherefore, the total amount of root beer available for the party was 20 + 13 + 8 = <<20+13+8=31>>31 gallons.\n\nSo, each person had 31 gallons / 3 people = <<31/3=10.33>>10.33 gallons to drink during the party.\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a gallon, we need to round up to the nearest whole number.
